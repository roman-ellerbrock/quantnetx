# QuantNetX

A comprehensive quantitative analytics platform for cryptocurrency options and derivatives markets. Real-time data analysis, risk metrics, and advanced visualization tools.

## Overview

QuantNetX provides professional-grade quantitative analysis tools for cryptocurrency derivatives. Currently featuring implied probability distributions from options prices using real-time Deribit API data.

## Current Features

### ðŸ“Š Implied Probability Distribution Dashboard

Extract risk-neutral probability distributions from options market prices using the butterfly spread approach (second derivative method):

- **Implied Probability Distribution**: Risk-neutral probability density derived from call and put options
- **Cumulative Distribution Function**: Cumulative probabilities for different strike prices
- **Option Price Derivatives**: Mark prices, first derivatives (delta), and second derivatives (gamma)

## Roadmap

ðŸš€ **Coming Soon:**
- Risk metrics (VaR, CVaR, Greeks)
- Volatility surface analysis
- Open interest analysis
- Historical volatility vs implied volatility
- Position sizing calculators
- Multi-asset correlation analysis

## Features

- âœ… Real-time data from Deribit API
- âœ… Support for BTC and ETH options
- âœ… Accurate second derivative calculation for non-uniformly spaced strikes
- âœ… Separate analysis for calls and puts
- âœ… Interactive Plotly charts with zoom and pan
- âœ… Dark theme, responsive design
- âœ… Zero dependencies (single HTML file)
- âœ… No build process required

## Quick Start

### Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it with any static file server:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push this code to the repository
3. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)"
6. Save and wait for deployment

Your dashboard will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/quantnetx/`

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd quantnetx
vercel
```

Or use the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com) to import your repository directly.

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Drag and drop the folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Or connect your GitHub repository at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)

## Technical Details

### Methodology

The implied probability distribution is calculated using the Breeden-Litzenberger formula:

```
P(K) = dÂ²C/dKÂ²
```

Where:
- `P(K)` is the probability density at strike K
- `C` is the call option price as a function of strike
- The second derivative is computed using finite differences for non-uniformly spaced strikes

For non-uniformly spaced points (xa, xb, xc) with values (fa, fb, fc):

```
f''(xb) = 2 * (fa * d2 + fc * d1 - fb * (d1 + d2)) / (d1 * d2 * (d1 + d2))
```

Where `d1 = xb - xa` and `d2 = xc - xb`.

The distribution is then normalized so that the probabilities sum to 1.

### Data Source

Options data is fetched in real-time from the [Deribit API](https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/):

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v2/public/get_book_summary_by_currency`
- **Parameters**:
  - `currency`: BTC or ETH
  - `kind`: option
- **Rate Limits**: Public API, no authentication required
- **Data**: Mark prices, implied volatility, strikes, open interest

### File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main dashboard (self-contained)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome/Edge (v90+)
- âœ… Firefox (v88+)
- âœ… Safari (v14+)
- âœ… Mobile browsers

Requires JavaScript enabled and internet connection for API access.

## API Usage

The dashboard makes direct calls to Deribit's public API. No API key is required, but be aware of rate limits:

- Public endpoints: ~20 requests per second
- No authentication needed
- CORS-enabled

## Development

The entire application is contained in a single `index.html` file with:

- Embedded CSS styles
- Embedded JavaScript (no external dependencies except Plotly CDN)
- No build process
- No package manager needed

To modify:

1. Edit `index.html` directly
2. Refresh your browser to see changes
3. All code is vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

### Code Structure

The JavaScript is organized into sections:

1. **Global Variables**: API constants and state
2. **Date/Time Utilities**: Expiry date parsing
3. **API Data Fetching**: Deribit API integration
4. **Probability Calculations**: Core probability math
5. **Derivative Calculations**: For visualization
6. **UI Utilities**: Formatting and helpers
7. **UI Updates**: Stats display
8. **Plotting Functions**: Plotly charts
9. **Event Handlers**: User interactions
10. **Event Listeners**: UI event bindings
11. **Initialization**: Page load
